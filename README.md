# CHATBOT WITH DEEP LEARNING AND NLP USIN PYTORCH FOR E-COMMERCE

This Chatbot project simply demonstrates how we can implement it in a way that its response will be accurate even though our prompt is not exactly the same in the conversation pairs that was implemented.

Little examples of what I tried to explain:

1) You can say 'good morning' or 'ahoy' to greet the chatbot.
   Now, even though these 2 prompts are not written anywhere, chatbot recognizes this as an greeting and replies accordingly.

2) You can say 'cash or card?' or 'is cash acceptable?' to learn if they accept cash payment method.
   Now, even though these 2 prompts are not written anywhere, chatbot recognizes this as an payment method question and replies accordingly.


This is how we are constructing our Training Data

Finally, a very general and simple explanation of our NLP Processing Pipeline.
